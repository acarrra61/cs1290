I changed the game so that whenever Lee scores points, it reduces from Alex’s score instead. I let dp(I,j) be the largest score which Alex can achieve which where the piles remaining are piles[I], piles[I+1],…,piles[j]. , I decided to make a recursion for dp(I,j) in terms of the dp(i+1,j) and dp(I,j-1) (dp stands for dynamic programming, which made sense to me for recursion) Since I needed to know what the value of each of the position of the game is . When the piles remaining are piles[i], piles[i+1],…,piles[j], the player who’s turn it is has the most two moves. The person who’s turn it was can be found by comparing j-1 to N. If the player is Alex, then she either takes the piles[i] or piles[j], increasing her score by that amount. After, the total score is either piles[i] + dp(i+1,j), or piles[j] + dp(I,j-1) and we want the Maximum possible score. If the player is Lee, then he either takes the piles[i] or piles[j] decreasing Alex’s score by that amount. Afterwords, the total score is either -piles[i] + dp(i+1,j), or -piles[j] + dp(I,j-1).  This is for the minimum possible score.
