IntegerBreak
As I was reading the example on this code problem, I realized that any input that is given let’s say 5, it has two possible solutions when you add them (which in this case it’s the product when you multiply them.) Also, right away I noticed I have to get the maximum product. When you add 1+4 you get 5 but when you multiply them you get 4, it goes the same with 2+3. But, when you multiply them you get 6, which is the maximum product. I will start off by talking about the code on what I used. On the sopl is where it represents the recursion call with any given value that is no less than 2 and not larger than 58. Then, the base case comes up with my linked list given the last element which is the product of the other elements. I use if-statements with the given value(n) if its less than or equal to 1 or if the value(n) is equal to 2(this is for n to be the right size). Next, is the for-loop where x+y = n (x is the first number, y is the 2nd number). The lists I made for x and y (xList,yList) has to be used with a recursion call for x and y getting the most product with its own method when I created it later, which is breaking the integer. Next, I used a resultList which I added the xList and yList and combined them to get the result with another method, which I used later being used (combineList). From here on out for every result in resultList. I compared results until I found the MaxList. Then, I returned it.
